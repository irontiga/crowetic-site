                        When you hear the word 'Blockchain' you immediately think of 'Bitcoin'. However, what most people aren't fully aware of
                        yet, is that blockchain technology can do a LOT more than money. Crowetic Computers is working on projects, that aim to demonstrate
                        this very fact.

                The purpose of mining is not the creation of new bitcoin. That’s the incentive system. Mining is the mechanism by which bitcoin’s
                security is decentralized. Mining can also be used for many other purposes, and to power other Blockchain based services
                that provide necessary and widely available options for society. Crowetic Computers is part of wave of Tier 1 companies
                to fully demonstrate the capability of Blockchain technology. and its fundamental uses
